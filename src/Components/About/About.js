						The reason for writing my first book – “Tell Me a Story” came from
						the need to leave something behind for my grandchildren. I wanted
						them to know the person that I am – to have some knowledge of how
						their ‘Nanny’ lived as a young child in England and how it differs
						from their own childhood. Growing up in England and living in the
						small Fenland village of Leverington for eighteen years of my life
						created for me a myriad of memories – some sad, but most of them
						very happy. I was born in the Fenland capital of Wisbech,
						Cambridgeshire, and lived in a house that my father built. It was
						there that I enjoyed an idyllic childhood within the safe and warm
						embrace of my loving family, good friends and a large and lovable
						extended family. Tell Me A Story… is a selection of stories drawn
						from my childhood memories – from my grandmother’s infamous jelly
						cubes to garden forks that go awry. From donkey rides to teenage
						crushes and a drummer boy that would make you smile. Set between the
						mid 1950s to 1970s, this memoir would appeal to adults and young
						adults alike; particularly those familiar with the Fenland district.

						I was born in the market town of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England in
						1953. My parents had met during the war in Egypt where my mother
						lived. When the war was over and after a lengthy engagement, they
						married and settled in the village of Leverington, near Wisbech,
						which is where my brother and myself grew up. My childhood, growing
						up in the Fenland district of England, was packed with fun and
						adventure, and yet at the same time, we were surrounded by the
						warmth and security of our loving parents. We always knew there was
						a safe haven to come home to at the end of each day. In September
						1972, at the age of eighteen, I left the security of my family in
						search of more adventure, and emigrated to Sydney, Australia, where
						I have lived now for 43 years. I have always had a love for writing
						and my plan, upon arriving in Australia, was to pursue a career in
						journalism. However, this was not to be – instead I followed the
						path of secretarial work for many years before marrying and having
						three sons.When my youngest son started school I went back into the
						workforce as a Teacher’s Aide (Special Needs) and stayed in that
						line of work for 13 years.The transition from being a Teacher’s aide
						in the Catholic School System to becoming a Pastoral Associate in
						the Catholic Church, which is where I have been employed for the
						past 12 years, was relatively smooth – it was a position I had been
						preparing for over the years, and I enjoy it immensely.
