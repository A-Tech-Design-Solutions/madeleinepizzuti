						Tell Me a Story… is a selection of stories drawn from my childhood
						memories – from my grandmother’s infamous jelly cubes to garden
						forks that go awry. From donkey rides to teenage crushes and a
						drummer boy that would make you smile. Set between the mid 1950s to
						1970s, this memoir would appeal to adults and young adults alike;
						particularly those familiar with the Fenland district. Growing up in
						England and living in the small Fenland village of Leverington for
						eighteen years of my life created for me a myriad of memories – some
						sad, but most of them very happy. I was born in the Fenland capital
						of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and lived in a house that my father
						built. It was there that I enjoyed an idyllic childhood within the
						safe and warm embrace of my loving family, good friends and a large
						and lovable extended family. I can still smell the country air that
						surrounded us as we sat amongst the gooseberry bushes that day. The
						aroma of cucumber sandwiches, tea from a flask, bales of prickly
						straw, mingled with the smell of strawberries ripening in the
						distance, created for me, a childhood memory that would last
						forever.
